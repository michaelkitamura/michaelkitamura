- Hi, I’m Michael Kitamura 
- I’m interested in Comptuers
- I’m currently learning Computer Engineering 
- I'm originally from Big Island of Hawaii
- I'm a sophomore in Computer Engineering
- I chose my major because I enjoy learning about how comptuers work and are built
- A fun fact about me is:  I am not good at programming 
- What do I want to learn from EE 205?  I want to learn about how to become a faster and more efficient programmer. 
- A book or movie I'd recommend is:  Gran Turismo
